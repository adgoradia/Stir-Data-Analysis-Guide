## Installing RStudio
To work with data in R, we will use the RStudio IDE, a free and open-source software. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, and it is extremely useful for providing valuable insights and experimenting with data. RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

###### Notes:
######  - When downloading RStudio, make sure to download the RStudio Desktop Version that is compatible with your computer. For example, if your laptop/desktop is a 32-bit machine, then download the 32-bit RStudio Desktop Version that corresponds with your operating system (Mac OSX/Windows). Similarly, if your computer is a 64-bit machine, then download the corresponding 64-bit version.
######  - RStudio includes a text editor, so you don't have to install another stand-alone editor (If you prefer a stand-alone editor, my top recommendations would be Komodo Edit and/or Atom)
######  - RStudio also includes an interface to Git and GitHub. You will need to install Git (covered in the next section), but RStudio provides a basic GUI for interacting with Git and GitHub.
